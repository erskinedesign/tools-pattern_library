# Pattern library


### Requirements
- Navigation is built up from directories (atoms, molecules etc.)
- Comments from Sass components are built into flat markup so that developers do not have to spend a lot of time developing a separate project.
- Emphasis on components rather than frameworks.
- View source link to repo on Github: components will be downloaded via Bower.
- Works without JS because we ought to test modules before we place them into the website.
- Load Javascript dependencies from comments in CSS.
- Components list the browser support with comments about reasoning.
